# Swarm_Robotics_19
Swarm robotics is the study of how to coordinate rhead large groups of relatively simple robots through the use of local rules. It takes its inspiration from societies of insects that can perform tasks that are beyond the capibilities of the individuals.

We have an overhead camera mounted to capture the view of the whole aren acontinously and detect the location and orientation of the robots through unique aruco marker placed on top of each robot. The user then inputs any shape into the GUI, which we map to the arena as the final coordinates that the robots must move to.
